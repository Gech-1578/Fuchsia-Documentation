# Fuchsia_GETAHUN_ABEBE

## A. OS Installation: Fuchsia

Fuchsia is an open-source operating system developed by Google.
To install Fuchsia, clone the source from fuchsia.dev and set up the build environment.
Use the fx tool to configure and build the system.
You can run Fuchsia on supported hardware or via the QEMU emulator.
Refer to the official documentation for hardware-specific instructions.

## B. System Call: socket

The socket system call creates an endpoint for communication.
In Fuchsia, sockets are handled through Zircon channels and the fdio library.
It supports standard socket types like SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM.
Use fdio_socket() or similar functions to interface with low-level sockets.
Socket communication is asynchronous and integrates with Fuchsiaâ€™s event-driven model.
